# Configuration

### `persistVariants`

- **Type**: `boolean`
- **Default**: `true`
- **Description**: This option determines whether to persist the A/B test variants across user sessions. When enabled (`true`), the assigned variant for each user is stored in a cookie on the user's device. This persistence ensures that once a user has been assigned a variant, they will experience consistent behavior across multiple sessions and visits.

### `variantMaxAge`

- **Type**: `number`
- **Default**: `2592000` (equivalent to 30 days)
- **Description**: Specifies the maximum age, in seconds, for the cookie that persists the A/B test variant assignment. This duration controls how long the user's variant assignment is remembered before it's considered expired. Once expired, the user may be assigned a new variant upon their next visit.

### `tests`

- **Type**: `ABTest[]`
- **Default**: `[]`
- **Description**: A list of A/B tests defined within the application. This array should include all the A/B tests you intend to run, each represented by an `ABTest` object. The framework uses this list to automatically generate the necessary components and composables for implementing the A/B tests in your application.


## Example Configuration

Here is an example of how you might configure the A/B testing module within your application:

```typescript
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ['.nuxt-ab-testing'],
  abTesting: {
    persistVariants: true,
    variantMaxAge: 60 * 60 * 7,
    tests: [
      {
        id: 'example-test',
        variants: [
          { id: 'variant-a', value: 'Variant A' },
          { id: 'variant-b', value: 'Variant B' },
        ],
      },
    ]
  }
})
```
